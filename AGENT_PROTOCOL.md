# Agent Protocol

FIndy ledger has been used to test out the ability to issue verifiable credentials as defined in the Hyperledger Indy [AnonCreds design](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/design/002-anoncreds). The implementation still uses the Hyperledger Indy standard [Agent Protocol Specification](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/agent/en/latest/README.html#messaging-protocol) as the basis for the communications between the Issuer and the Holder / Prover.

Further on the plan is to transition to using the [HIPE agent connection protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0031-connection-protocol) as the basis for the agent-to-agent communications in the FIndy network.
